# GlobalCancerPatients Database Management System

## 📘 Project Title
**GlobalCancerPatients - A Comprehensive Database Management System Using MySQL**

## 📝 Description

This project involves the design and implementation of a full-featured **Database Management System (DBMS)** for managing global cancer patient records. The data is sourced from publicly available medical datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), and the system is built entirely using **MySQL**.

The aim is to demonstrate strong knowledge of database design principles including normalization, relationship modeling, data integrity through constraints, and efficient SQL implementation.

## 🎯 Key Features

- A well-structured **relational database** built in MySQL.
- Implementation of:
  - Primary Keys (PK)
  - Foreign Keys (FK)
  - NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
- Logical relationships:
  - One-to-One (1:1)
  - One-to-Many (1:M)
  - Many-to-Many (M:N) relationships
- Clean, readable, and **well-commented SQL code**.

## 🏗️ How to Set Up / Run the Project

1. Ensure you have **MySQL** installed on your machine (MySQL Workbench or MySQL Server).
2. Clone this repository or download the `.sql` file.
3. Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred SQL client.
4. Create a new schema/database:  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE GlobalCancerPatients;
   USE GlobalCancerPatients;
